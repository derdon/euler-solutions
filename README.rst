About
-----
This is a git repository which provides solutions for the `Project Euler`_.
What's so special about this project? **Solutions are grouped by their
problem** and each directory represents one problem. Each directory may
contain more than one implementation (programming language or generally
the way of approaching the problem). Another difference from other
“euler-repos” is the **community-oriented** behaviour; see the following
section for more information.

How to contribute
-----------------
Contributions are welcome! To **add a solution** in a language that does not
exist yet or which uses a method / approach that does not exist yet, `fork
this repository`_ and send me a pull request.
